                        <p class="text-left p-2">It is important to find out as much as possible about the property you are considering purchasing before the sale and purchase agreement is finalised.</p>
                        <p>The real estate salesperson represents the seller. He or she will tell you a lot about the property and will answer any questions, but you should do your own research as well.​ </p>
                        <p>We recommend you get these key reports before placing a non-conditional offer on a property.</p>
                        <h4>Ti​t​le search </h4>
                        <p>A​ title search gives you all the records about the property that are held by Land Information New Zealand (LINZ). It shows the legal owner of the property, the legal description and any rights and restrictions against the property
                            title – such as a mortgage or access across the property (easements).​</p>
                        <p>The agent listing the property should also have got a copy of the title. If they notice any restrictions that may affect you as the buyer, they must pass this information on to you. If there are any issues raised, you can get your
                            own advice about these issues and any potential impacts.</p>
                        <p>Your lawyer can help you get a title search or you can get it yourself from LINZ. You will need to pay a fee and the process may take time. Your lawyer can help you understand the report.​​​​</p>
                        <h4>Land Information Memorandum (LIM)</h4>
                        <p>The LIM is a comprehensive report provided by the local council about all the important current and historical information the council knows about the property, including: </p>
                        <ul class="">
                            <li class="">potential erosion, subsidence or slippage, flooding of any type and possible presence of hazardous substances</li>
                            <li class="">information on private and public storm water and sewerage drains</li>
                            <li class="">rates information</li>
                            <li class="">any consents, notices, orders or requisitions affecting the land or buildings</li>
                            <li class="">District Plan classifications relating to the land or buildings</li>
                            <li class="">any other classifications that relate to the land or buildings</li>
                            <li class="">any other classifications on the land or buildings notified to the council by network utility operators in relation to the Building Act 2004.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Your lawyer can help you get a LIM or you can get it yourself from the local council. You will need to pay a fee and the process may take time. Your lawyer can help you understand the LIM.​​​</p>
                        <h4>Property inspection report</h4>
                        <p>A qualified property inspector will tell you about the condition of the property.</p>
                        <p>It’s a good idea to select a property inspector and/or engineer at an early stage of your home buying process so you are ready to arrange an inspection when you find a property you want to buy. We recommend you choose a property
                            inspector who has professional indemnity insurance and carries out their work in accordance with the New Zealand Property Inspection Standards.</p>
                        <p>Inspectors who conform to this standard can be found on the Building Officials Institute of New Zealand website and on the New Zealand Institute of Building Surveyors website. Other inspectors not listed on those websites may also
                            conform to the New Zealand Standard.</p>
                        <p>You will need to pay for a property inspection.</p>
                        <p>Depending on the property you may also want to hire other specialist advisors such as a valuer or structural engineer to help you decide whether you want to buy the property and how much you would be willing to pay for it.</p>

                        <p>Your financial lender may ask you to provid​e a valuation report for the property.</p>
                        <p>You can read more about researching a property and how to get these reports in our Home Buyers’ Guide. Download the Home Buyers' Guide (pdf 253KB).​</p>
                        <h4>Ask the salesperson</h4>
                        <p>You can ask the real estate salesperson anything you want to know about the property and they cannot withhold any information they know. Also, they can't make statements about the property they cant back up with evidence.</p>
                        <h4>Other things you may want to get checked out</h4>
                        <p>Depending on the type of property and what you know about the property, here are some other things that it may be appropriate to check out or ask questions about:</p>
                        <ul class="">
                            <li class="">Weather tightness</li>

                            <p>​​We publish a sale and purchase agreement guide. The salesperson must give you a copy of the guide before you sign a sale and purchase agreement. We recommend reading the guide early in the buying and selling process.</p>
                            <h3>Know what's in the sale and purchase agreement</h3>
                            <p>The sale and purchase agreement sets out all the agreed terms and conditions, including these basic clauses:</p>
                            <ul class="">
                                <li class="">the price</li>
                                <li class="">chattels (for example, fixed floor coverings, whiteware or curtains) included in the sale</li>
                                <li class="">the type of title (for example, freehold or leasehold)</li>
                                <li class="">any conditions the buyer or seller wants fulfilled before the contract is agreed</li>
                                <li class="">the date the agreement will become unconditional</li>
                                <li class="">the settlement date</li>
                                <li class="">any deposit the buyer must pay.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p><b>Clauses about obligations and conditions</b></p>
                            <p>The agreement will also include clauses that set out obligations and conditions that the buyer and/or seller must abide by. These may include what access the buyer can have to inspect the property before settlement and ensuring
                                the property remains insured until the settlement date.</p>
                            <p><b>Clauses about default by the buyer or seller</b></p>
                            <p>Clauses are also likely to cover what happens if the buyer or seller defaults. This covers compensation costs that must be paid by the buyer or seller if either defaults on the terms of the agreement, for example, by delaying
                                settlement. Your lawyer can explain these clauses to you.​</p>
                            <h3>You cannot change your mind after you have signed</h3>
                            <p>In general, when you have signed the agreement and the conditions set out in the agreement have been met, you have to go ahead with the purchase of the property.</p>
                            <h3>Buyer’s deposit</h3>
                            <p>When the buyer and seller have signed the sale and purchase agreement, the offer is accepted. </p>
                            <p>The buyer must pay a deposit – usually 5–10 % of the purchase price. The deposit details will be set out in the sales and purchase agreement. The buyer can negotiate when the deposit is paid, for example, when the (conditional)
                                offer is accepted or when the agreement becomes unconditional.​</p>
                            <h3>The settlement date</h3>
                            <p>The agreement will also specify the settlement date – the date when the buyer pays the rest of the amount agreed for the property, usually through their lawyer. This is typically also the possession date, when the buyer takes
                                possession of the property.​</p>

                            <p>We recommend that all agents selling residential property use these clauses and we are advising vendors to only enter into residential agency agreements with real estate agents who use the recommended standard clauses in their

                            <p><b>For general agency agreements, the standard clauses set out that:</b></p>
                            <ul class="">
                                <li class="">​agreements can be cancelled on seven days’ written notice</li>
                                <li class="">an agent can only claim a commission if a sale and purchase agreement is signed during the term of the general agency agreement and where:
                                    <br />- ​the agent has been instrumental in bringing about the sale and purchase agreement , or
                                    <br />- the sale and purchase agreement is signed with someone introduced by the agent
                                </li>
                                <p>For both sole and general agency agreements, the sale and purchase agreement must eventually become unconditional. The agent can still claim a commission even if the sale and purchase agreement becomes unconditional after
                                    the agency agreement has ended. </p>

                            <h3>3 things you need to tell us when you renew your licence</h3>
                            <p><b>1. Continuing Education</b></p>
                            <p>Each calendar year you must complete verifiable and non-verifiable continuing education. When you renew your licence you need to confirm you have completed the non-verifiable continuing education required for previous calendar
                                year. (REAA automatically receives notification about the verifiable continuing education you have completed from the course provider, so you don’t need to provide us with those details).</p>
                            <p>Each year we run a random audit of non-verifiable continuing education completion logs so it is important that you keep these up to date.</p>
                            <p><b>2.	Eligibility</b></p>
                            <p>You will need to make an eligibility declaration to renew your licence. Eligibility for a licence is covered by sections 36 and 37 of the Real Estate Agents Act 2008. Section 36 sets out the eligibility criteria. Section 37
                                sets out circumstances that prohibit a person from being licensed. </p>
                            <p>The requirement to be a “fit and proper” person applies in addition to the prohibitions that apply under section 37 of the Act. In other words, a person may not be prohibited from holding a licence under section 37 but may
                                nevertheless not satisfy the REAA Registrar that he or she is a fit and proper person. </p>
                            <p>Licensees are under a duty at all times to notify the Registrar of any change in circumstances that may result in them no longer being a fit and proper person to be licensed. It is the Registrar’s decision whether you are a
                                fit and proper person to hold a licence. If there has been a change in circumstances that may result in the Registrar not being satisfied that you are a fit and proper person to hold a licence, you must notify the Registrar
                                of that change in circumstance. </p>
                            <p>If you sign the renewal application form and do not disclose any matter impacting your eligibility to hold a licence, including any matter that may result in a decision that you are no longer a fit and proper person to hold
                                a licence, you will be committing an offence. If you are granted a licence on the basis of any false or fraudulent representation or declaration made orally or in writing your licence must be cancelled.</p>
                            <p>Matters which may be considered by the Registrar for the fit and proper person assessment (in addition to the section 37 prohibitions) include:</p>
                            <ul class="">
                                <li class="">​any criminal conviction not already brought to REAA’s attention, which has not been “clean slated” under the Criminal Records (Clean Slate) Act 2004. This includes any excess breath alcohol conviction and any traffic offence
                                    that resulted in a conviction;</li>
                                <li class="">any pending criminal charges (in New Zealand or overseas);</li>
                                <li class="">any unsatisfied judgements in any court;</li>
                                <li class="">any adverse findings against you by a court in civil proceedings; </li>
                                <li class="">any significant financial issues, such as bankruptcy or liquidation/receivership of a company of which you are a director; and</li>
                                <li class="">disciplinary action taken by another regulatory or professional body in New Zealand or overseas.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>This does not include any open complaints being considered by a Complaints Assessment Committee or the Real Estate Agents Disciplinary Tribunal. However, if you owe any outstanding costs or fines resulting from a disciplinary
                                matter or have not complied with any other order this should be declared.</p>
                            <p>Note: licensees are required by the Real Estate Agents Act 2008 to advise the Registrar of any change of circumstances that affects their eligibility to hold a licence, within 10 working days of the change occurring, including
                                any change in circumstances that may result in the licensee no longer being a fit and proper person to be licensed. If anything occurred during the year that has affected your eligibility to hold the licence, you should
                                by law have advised the Registrar at the time. </p>
                            <p>To be eligible to hold a branch manager’s or agent’s licence you must have had 3 years real estate agency work experience in the last 10 years. Each year you need to confirm you still meet this requirement. Note: residential
                                letting and leasing does not qualify as real estate agency work.</p>
                            <p><b>3.	Consent and certification</b></p>
                            <p>As part of the re-licensing process, you will give your consent to REAA to carry out a criminal history check. Additionally, the Registrar may make specific inquiries of the New Zealand Police to elicit information that the
                                Registrar reasonably considers relevant to her decision whether you are a fit and proper person to hold a licence.​</p>
                            <h3>Your declarations</h3>
                            <p>Please be open and frank in your disclosure to REAA. If in doubt, it is best to include. </p>
                            <p>Don’t wait until your licence renewal if you have matters of concern to report. You must advise REAA of any matter that might affect your eligibility to hold a real estate licence (see Regulation 10 of the Real Estate Agents
                                (Licensing) Regulations 2009).</p>
                            <p>In most cases, things that you declare won't be serious enough to prevent your licence being renewed. In some cases, REAA will ask you for further information. If we have to ask other people for more information about something
                                you have declared, we will let you know. Your licence will be “active-pending renewal” while we do this. </p>
                            <p>When your application to renew has been approved, we will email a copy of your licence to you. You can also find a copy in the “My Documents” section of the Licensee Portal. </p>
                            <h3>Voluntary information you can provide when renewing your licence</h3>
                            <ul class="">
                                <li class="">Ethnicity and languages: REAA is collecting information about ethnicity and languages spoken to help us gain a better understanding of the makeup and diversity of the profession. </li>
                                <li class="">Type of real estate work: If you provide information about the type of real estate you do (residential, rural or commercial) this will show on the public register.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>If you have any questions about the online declaration please don’t hesitate to call a member of the REAA Licensing Team on 0800 367 7322.</p>
                            <h3>​We will remind you that your licence is about to expire</h3>
                            <p>We will send you a renewal notification four to six weeks before your licence expires – by email and text. Make sure your contact details are up to date so you receive this reminder. </p>
                            <p>You can also check the date your licence will expire on our public register, in the Licensee Portal​, or on your evidence of licence.</p>
                            <p>It's a good idea to put this important date in your calendar.</p>
                            <p><b>If we do not receive your renewal application and payment before your licence expiry date, your licence will expire.</b>That means you will no longer be able to carry out real estate agency work and you will need to reapply
                                for your licence.</p>
                            <p>If you do not want to renew your licence you can simply let it expire. You can also suspend or surrender your licence before the expiry date.</p>

                            <p>​One of the ways the Act achieves its twin purpose of consumer protection and the promotion of public confidence in the performance of real estate agency work, is by “raising industry standards”. Sections 3(1) and 2(b) of the
                                Act.​​
                            </p>

                            <p>Standards​​​ or guidelines are not enforceable rules, but are an important tool to maintain or raise standards to:</p>
                            <ul class="">
                                <li class="">provide guidance to the sector so it can identify a benchmark for performance or behaviour</li>
                                <li class="">provide certainty on what the regulator expects from the sector in terms of acceptable practice</li>
                                <li class="">in some instances, enable organisations to adapt the general principles and guidelines in a way that is fit-for-purpose for the organisation, recognising that one size does not necessarily fit all</li>
                                <li class="">assist the regulated sector where legislative or regulatory provisions are unclear</li>
                                <li class="">assist those who wish to comply to meet acceptable standards</li>
                                <li class="">lay a better foundation for enforcement action in cases of non-compliance.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>REAA is introducing professional standards as a proactive form of regulatory intervention. The objective is to provide a benchmark for best practice to inform compliance advice, Complaints Assessment Committee and Real Estate
                                Agents Disciplinary Tribunal decision-making, agency policies and procedures and consumer expectations.</p>
                            <p>In the absence of widely accepted industry standards of best practice, disciplinary decisions have tended toward maintaining minimum standards rather than raising standards.</p>
                            <p>The REAA professional standards, which REAA will develop over time, will change that dynamic.</p>
                            <h3>Supervision Training </h3>
                            <p>For supervision to be effective it must be tailored to the needs of the individual. For that reason REAA has not provided a standard template for supervision. We have, however included a range of questions designed to support
                                the development of supervision plans for your agency, these include:</p>
                            <ul class="">
                                <li class="">Do employment contracts include the details of the supervising agent or branch manager? Are these reviewed and updated as situations change?</li>
                                <li class="">Do you understand the level of knowledge and the strengths and weaknesses of the people you supervise? Is your supervision plan appropriate with their level of knowledge?</li>
                                <li class="">Do you have more stringent supervision for licensees new to the industry or to your organisation?</li>
                                <li class="">Does your supervision plan differ for staff working remotely?</li>
                                <li class="">Do you review every sale and purchase / lease agreement presented by licensees you supervise?</li>
                                <li class="">Is the work of the licensees you supervise randomly reviewed and recorded? </li>
                                <li class="">Do the people you supervise have a training and development plan? Are the outcomes of these plans recorded in writing? </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>REAA have developed a two-hour supervision training programme aimed at agents and branch managers, this training programme can count towards non-verifiable Continuing Education. One of the mandatory topics for all licensees
                                Continuing Education in 2018 will be on Supervision Standards. Check out approved providers of Supervision training. </p>
                            <p>The Supervision Standard is the first Standard released by REAA, with another following in 2018. For further information and support; contact the REAA licensing team on 0800 367 7322. </p>
